### Origin

So, I have a lot of useless file on my disk, and I want to clean everything, but the the shit disk manager of that ass Windows is very slow, I can't see what is using a lot of space in my disk, and can't explore that easily. The Windows Explorer don't show for me the size of folder, and I need to see each.

That is Disk Analyzer, is simple, fast for specific directory (Sometiems can be slow if that directory have like +10k files)
